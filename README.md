just walked out of Kimge kereksin and wow my mind is still whirling like one of those old carnival rides, you know the ones that make you question your entire existence? anyway, there’s popcorn something stuck in my teeth as I try to wrap my head around this movie. 

so there’s these loud moments with music pounding louder than the guy two rows back snoring like a freight train, but somehow it fits, like the chaos of my apartment when I’m trying to find my keys. and the scenes kept flashing, quick and surreal, like those dreams you get after binge-watching nature documentaries on a lousy mattress.

> this scene, this stunning scene where suddenly everything pauses, like when you’re waiting for toast to pop but it never does, and in that silence, there’s this raw poetry. sure I didn’t quite get every bit of dialogue, kinda like talking to my grandma on the phone. but something just clicks deep inside and you come out feeling like you stumbled upon new pieces of yourself.

I was asked whether to download the movie or you know, watch the movie later calmly at home away from the commotion. maybe watch with headphones on, because each background sound felt like it was narrating its own tale alongside the main story.  

some scenes just clash like peanut butter and pickles. sounds gross, yeah? but unexpectedly? there’s a weird craving to it. and in the chaos there’s moments of clarity, small gestures, fleeting glances, like catching lightning bugs in a jar. 

and my back is aching from the theater seat that feels like it might’ve been made of bricks, but kind of adds to the whole experience of being jostled around by the plot. and now I’m supposed to head home, but it’s like trying to navigate a maze after spinning in a chair—disorienting yet somehow exhilarating.
